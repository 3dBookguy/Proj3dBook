Building "Tedder"

Loading Proj3dBook into Visual Studio:
   
Double cliking on 3dBook.sln should load the Proj3dBook into Visual Studio.

If you get the project loaded, run Debug (F5) and Tedder compiles and runs
properly you probably don't need this file.

Below is a "Building Diary" of my test build on an older machine running Windows 8 - VS - 2013.

1.) Choose a directory for the cloned repo.
	
2.) I opened bash in C:\Users\Pete\Documents

3.) git clone https://github.com/3dBookguy/Proj3dBook.git
	This created the directory C:\Users\Pete\Documents\Proj3dBook

	with the following sub directories

		C:\Users\Pete\Documents\Proj3dBook\images
		C:\Users\Pete\Documents\Proj3dBook\Shade
		C:\Users\Pete\Documents\Proj3dBook\doc
		C:\Users\Pete\Documents\Proj3dBook\debug


	This is different from the directory structure of the Windows 10 machine I pushed the repo to git from.

  	The directory structure on my local machine is C:\Users	\Pstan ...\Proj3dBook\src\images

	The is no src is not there on the clone?

4.)  Double click on ...\Proj3dBook\3dBook.sln
	This opened Proj3dBook in VS - 2013

5.)  VS F5 to run degug
	Error	1	error MSB8020: The builds tools for v141 (Platform Toolset = 'v141') cannot be found.

Fix: In VS:  Project/3dBook Properties/Configuration Properties/Platform Tooset
		/Visual Studio 2017 (v141)

Changed Visual Studio 2017 (v141) to Visual Studio 2012 (v110)    

6.)  VS F5 to run debug

12 errors like below

Cannot open include file: 'excpt.h': No such file or directory

Fix: Property Pages/VC++ Directories/Include Directories - change to match the settings of other projects on the Windows 8 - VS - 2013 machine.


7.)  VS F5 to run debug

Success - Tedder up and running

Property Pages:

Cloning brings 3dBook's project settings(Property Pages) as they are in my local repo 
to your local repo.  These are unlikely to match.  If you have a VS project that uses
the same APIs as Tedder( DirectWrite, D2D, OpenGL, GLEW, and GLM ).  Matching the  
the 3dBook include settings in Property Pages to your VS project Property Pages should
work.

Some Property Page setting to check.
